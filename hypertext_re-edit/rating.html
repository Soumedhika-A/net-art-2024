        Goa: 4/5
        Although Goa is renowned for its beautiful beaches and lively culture, 
        I felt that it was a little overhyped and lacked the authentic Indian atmosphere I had anticipated. 
        It appeared to be more like a foreign nation than a region of India. 
        Even though many people found this foreign ambiance intriguing, 
        I wished there was a stronger connection to traditional Indian culture 
        and components that more accurately reflected India's rich legacy.

        Taj Mahal: 5/5
        I am extremely moved by its exquisite beauty and the moving love tale that led to its construction. 
        I will always carry in my heart the timeless story of Emperor Shah Jahan's love for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, 
        as represented by this majestic building. Every visit to the Taj Mahal is an intensely emotional experience 
        because it is more than simply a monumentâ€”it is a representation of history, artistry, and unwavering love.

        Hyderabad: infinity/5
        My beloved homeland of Hyderabad deserves an infinite rating because it is truly remarkable. 
        The vibrant vitality of places like HITEC City and the city's rich history, 
        which are showcased in magnificent structures like the Charminar, combine to 
        create a microcosm of India's variety. I find Hyderabad to be a place not just to live but also to 
        have my heart and soul because of its friendliness, delicious food, and dynamic culture.
