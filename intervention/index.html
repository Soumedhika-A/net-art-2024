      I chose ebay as my platform to sell my kpop photocards because I know of a lot of people 
      trying to sell their kpop albums, photocards, or posters here. Also, I wanted to test the kpop photocards craze and see
      how the entire selling process works. 
      So I started off by going on ebay to sell the following popular photocards from different boy bands.
      I first searched each item on ebay to see for how much people were selling at.
      I decided to sell it at a higher than what it was selling for. 
      I was only able to put my photocards on sale for 2 days as I didn't have my photocards with me earlier.
      I will be breaking down the photocards I put up for sale so it's easier to follow along.

    <h3>Photocard 1: NCT Taeyong Resonance  Pt.2</h3>

      I saw that this photocard was being sold for $40~60, so I decided to sell it for $70 to see if people buy it.
      Although I couldn't sell it, I feel like if I had more time then I could get more people to view it as I was able to get 2 views in 2 days.

    <h3>Photocard 2: NCT Dream Mark Lee Hot Sauce</h3>
    <img src="img/mark_doc.jpg" alt="Mark" style="width:15%;">
    <p>
      I saw that this photocard was being sold for $12, so I decided to sell it for $20 to see if people buy it.
      I couldn't sell this one and couldn't get people to view this item as it's not that popular compared to my other photocards I'm selling.

    <h3>Photocard 3: SUPERM Baekhyun Super One</h3>

    <p>
      I saw that this photocard was being sold for $40~60, so I decided to sell it for $70 to see if people buy it.
      Although I couldn't sell it, I feel like if I had more time then I could get more people to view it as I was able to get 1 view in 2 days.

      In conclusion, I couldn't sell any of my photocards as I made two mistakes. 
      If I could redo this assignment, I would change the pricing of these photocards to be lower
      than the items that are were already up on ebay by others. 
      This way I could sell my photocards before those. Moreover, I would put up my ebay listing earlier so it can attract more viewers.
      Overall, it was a fun experience and if I could resit then I will definitely implement the above.
